# C++ Module 01

This module covers various topics in C++, including memory allocation, pointers to members, references, and the switch statement. It consists of several exercises that involve creating classes, working with strings, and managing memory.

## Exercise 00: BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ

In this exercise, you will implement a `Zombie` class with a `name` attribute and a member function `announce()` that makes the zombie announce itself. Additionally, you'll create functions `newZombie()` and `randomChump()` to create and manage zombies.

## Exercise 01: Moar brainz!

This exercise involves creating a `Zombie` horde by allocating multiple `Zombie` objects in a single allocation. You'll initialize each `Zombie` with a given name and implement tests to ensure the function works correctly.

## Exercise 02: HI THIS IS BRAIN

In this exercise, you'll explore memory addresses and references. You'll have a string variable, a pointer to the string, and a reference to the string, and you'll print their memory addresses and values.

## Exercise 03: Unnecessary violence

This exercise focuses on implementing a `Weapon` class with a private attribute `type` and member functions to get and set the `type`. You'll then create two classes `HumanA` and `HumanB`, each with a `Weapon` and a name, and a member function `attack()` to display their attacks.

## Exercise 04: Sed is for losers

This exercise involves creating a program that takes three parameters: a filename, and two strings `s1` and `s2`. The program will open the file and create a new file with the content, replacing every occurrence of `s1` with `s2`.

## Exercise 05: Harl 2.0

In this exercise, you'll create a `Harl` class that represents a person who makes various comments categorized by levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR). You'll implement pointer-to-member functions to automate the comments and create a public function to call different comment levels.

## Exercise 06: Harl filter

The last exercise involves filtering Harl's comments based on the log levels. The program takes a log level as a parameter and displays all messages from that level and above.
